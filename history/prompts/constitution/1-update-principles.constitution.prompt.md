# Constitution Update for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Request
Update the project constitution to include specific principles for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook project, focusing on academic rigor and content quality.

## Response
Updated the constitution file to include 8 core principles for the textbook:
1. Primary Sources Mandatory - All chapters must cite primary sources only
2. Verification Requirement - All claims must be verified against sources
3. APA Citation Standard - Use APA format for citations
4. Zero Plagiarism Tolerance - All content in original wording
5. Visual Content Requirement - Each chapter needs images/diagrams
6. Student-Friendly Language - Written for university-level participants
7. MDX Format Compliance - Compatible with Docusaurus
8. Peer-Reviewed Sources Threshold - Minimum 12 sources across the book

Also updated dependent templates (plan, spec, tasks) to align with these principles.

## Outcome
The constitution has been successfully updated with version 1.1.0, and all related templates have been modified to ensure consistency with the new principles. The changes emphasize academic standards, source verification, and accessibility requirements.
