# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

For the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook project, ensure all plans comply with these constitutional principles:
- All content must cite primary sources only (official NVIDIA docs, ROS 2 documentation, IEEE/arXiv papers, Unitree/Robotis GitHub repos, Isaac Sim tutorials, or official textbooks)
- All technical claims must be verified against the cited primary sources before writing
- APA 7th edition citation format required for both in-text and References section
- Zero plagiarism - every sentence must be paraphrased in original words
- Each chapter must contain at least 2–3 visual elements: screenshots, diagrams, architecture figures, or Mermaid flowcharts
- Content must be engaging and student-friendly for university students and hackathon participants
- All content must use MDX format only (so code blocks, tabs, admonitions, and interactive components render perfectly in Docusaurus)
- Include runnable ROS 2 Python code snippets with proper syntax highlighting
- Minimum 15 high-quality sources required across the entire book (at least 10 must be peer-reviewed papers or official NVIDIA/ROS documentation)
- All content must be compatible with Docusaurus v3 (classic template), MDX v3, dark mode enabled, Algolia DocSearch, responsive for mobile
- Deployment to GitHub Pages (username.github.io repo) with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- All code examples must be tested and verified to run correctly

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
